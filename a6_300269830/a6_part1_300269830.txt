Question 1
Suppose n = 10,000
The function largest_34(a) has 1 for loop, which executes 10,000 operations.
So, it performs O(n) operations.


Question 2
Suppose n = 10,000
The function largest_third(a) has 1 for loop, which executes 10,000 operations.
So, it performs O(n) operations.


Question 3
Suppose n = 10,000
The function third_at_least(a) has 1 for loop, which executes 10,000 operations.
So, it performs O(n) operations.

Question 4
Suppose n = 10,000
The sum_tri(a,x) has 3 nested for loops. The inner loop executes 10,000*10,000 times for each step for the outer loop.
The middle inner loop executes 10,000 times for each step of outer loop.
Therefore, this function performs roughly 10,000 * 10,000 * 10,000 operations. So, it performs O(n^3) operations.
